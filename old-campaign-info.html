    <h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px;">Why playing the piano shouldn't hurt.</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        I've been a concert pianist for years. But I have a confession: <strong>I always struggled with the size of the
            keyboard.</strong> It was just a tiny bit too big for my hands.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        For years, I thought it was <em>my</em> fault. I thought I just needed to practice more or stretch further. But
        then I realized: <strong>I wasn't alone.</strong>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        That’s why I created <strong>DreamPlay One</strong>. It isn't just a "smaller keyboard". It's a professional
        instrument designed to fit your hands, not fight them.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Why DreamPlay One?</h3>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <strong style="color: #2563eb;"> Reach More, Strain Less</strong><br>
        The keys are slightly narrower (15/16ths or 7/8ths of standard). This means you can finally reach octaves and
        large chords without stretching until it hurts.
    </div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <strong style="color: #2563eb;"> University Approved</strong><br>
        We use the official "DS Standard" sizes. These are the exact same sizes used by top universities worldwide. You
        are playing on a professional standard, not a toy.
    </div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <strong style="color: #2563eb;"> Concert Hall Sound</strong><br>
        We didn't sacrifice quality for comfort. We partnered with top sound engineers to ensure the DreamPlay One
        sounds as rich and grand as it feels.
    </div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <strong style="color: #2563eb;"> Play Anywhere</strong><br>
        It’s lightweight and compact. Take your music with you, wherever you go.
    </div>

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Choose Your Perfect Fit</h3>

        Designed for pianists with hands under 7.6 inches. This size allows players in "Zone A" to play octaves and 9ths
        with ease, and even the occasional 10th interval comfortably.
    </div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <strong style="color: #2563eb;"> DS6.0 ("Medium" Size)</strong><br>
        Designed for pianists with hands between 7.6 and 8.5 inches. This size allows players in "Zone B" to play
        octaves and 9ths with ease, and the occasional 10th without strain.

        <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 15px;">Risks & Challenges</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
            Every crowdfunding campaign involves some risk, but we have mitigated the biggest ones already:
        </p>
        <ul style="color: #555; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>✅ <strong>Prototype is finished:</strong> We aren't guessing; the piano works.</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Manufacturer secured:</strong> We have partnered with a reputable factory.</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Experienced Team:</strong> We know music and logistics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Production Reality</h4>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #555;">
            <strong>1. Tooling (90 Days):</strong> The most complex part is creating the steel molds for our custom
            15/16th size keys. This takes approximately 3 months. We cannot rush this without risking quality.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #555;">
            <strong>2. Delivery Date (August 2026):</strong> We have built a 2-month buffer into our timeline to account
            for potential ocean freight delays or customs congestion.
        </p>

        <p style="color: #555; margin-top: 20px;">
            We promise 100% transparency. You will be updated every single month with photos from the factory floor
            until the DreamPlay One is in your living room.
        </p>

        <p style="color: #555; margin-top: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
            We are working <strong>overtime</strong> to make sure you get your <strong>DreamPlay One</strong> within the
            estimated time frame. If we cannot hit the deadline, you have the option of getting your <u><strong>100% of
                    your money back</strong></u>, or <strong>keeping your reservation spot</strong>.

<p>I've been a concert pianist for years, performing at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and venues around the world. But
    there's something most people never saw: I was constantly fighting against the piano.</p>
<p>My hands span just under 8.5 inches. That meant many traditional pieces were difficult, sometimes impossible, for me
    to play comfortably. No matter how much I practiced, I felt like the instrument wasn't built for me.</p>
<p class="font-semibold text-foreground">So I asked myself: "What if the piano could be designed to fit the pianist,
    instead of the other way around?"</p>
<p class="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">That's where DreamPlay was born.</p>

<div class="space-y-4">
    <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Most pianos are designed for large hand spans, at least 8.5
        inches. But <span class="font-bold text-foreground">87% of women</span> and <span
            class="font-bold text-foreground">24% of men</span> fall short of that.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">That means strain, tension, and frustration. I know because
        I lived it.</p>
